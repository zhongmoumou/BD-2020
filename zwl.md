“FOSS” (Free and Open Source Software) means any software that is subject to terms that, as a condition of use, copying, modification or redistribution, require such software and/or derivative works thereof to be disclosed or distributed in source code form, to be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or to be redistributed free of charge, including without limitation software distributed under the GNU General Public License or GNU Lesser/Library GPL.

“Updates” means bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements and supplements to the Apple Software or Apple Services, and any new releases or versions thereof.

“Xcode Developer Tools” means the Apple-proprietary development platform, including but not limited to software tools, compilers, sample code, Documentation, programming languages, and overall design package provided by Apple hereunder, excluding the Apple SDKs.
